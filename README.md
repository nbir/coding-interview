A collection of programming exercises to prepare for a coding interview. Click on the links below to view the solution.

There are a few more exercises that aren't necessarily correct, covers all edge cases, or are efficient [here â†—](./extras/).

To run a Python program simply run `python <filename.py>`.

To run a C program run `gcc <filename>.c -o ./<filename>.out && ./<filename>.out`.
